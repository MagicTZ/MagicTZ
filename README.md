# Hi! I'm **Zhen Tan (谭臻)**

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), supervised by [Prof. Dewen Hu (CAS Academician)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37271079500) and [Assoc. Prof. Xieyuanli Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DvrngV4AAAAJ&hl).
Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), guided by [Prof. Yusheng Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U1xaKegAAAAJ&hl=en), and my Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University (WHU).

My research vision aims to bridge **High-Fidelity 3D Vision** (NeRF/3DGS) and **Embodied Intelligence**.  
I focus on building robust **Spatial Representations** and **World Models** that enable robots to understand and interact with dynamic environments.

### **RA-L 2025**
**TVG-SLAM: Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Tri-view Geometric Constraints** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23207) 

- Proposed a tri-view geometric constraint to stabilize 3DGS in texture-less or repetitive regions.  
- Achieved tightly-coupled optimization of tracking & mapping for robust outdoor SLAM.
